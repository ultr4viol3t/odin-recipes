        <ol>
          <li>
            Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add potatoes and
            garlic, lower heat to medium, and simmer until potatoes are tender,
            15 to 20 minutes.
          </li>
          <li>
            When the potatoes are almost finished, heat milk and butter in a
            small saucepan over low heat until butter is melted.
          </li>
          <li>
            Drain potatoes and return to the pot. Slowly add warm milk mixture,
            blending it in with a potato masher or electric mixer until potatoes
            are smooth and creamy. Season with salt and pepper.
          </li>
          <li><em>Serve hot and enjoy!</em></li>
